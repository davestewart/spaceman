## Abstract

Workspaces provide a streamlined workflow to manage multiple packages within a single repository, but require a certain amount of knowledge, configuration and terminal-fu for everyday tasks.

Spaceman makes running complex or multistep tasks easier by wrapping them in prompts, and batching commands on confirmation:

# Tasks

## Packages

### Scripts

Run any root or package script:

```
Script              - type to filter scripts
```

Confirming will run the selected script.

To exclude scripts (for example those starting with `~`) you can add an exclusion filter in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "spaceman": {
    "scripts": {
      "exclude": "^~"
    }
  }
}
```

## Packages

### Install

Install one or more packages to a target repository:

```
Workspace           - pick the target workspace to install to
Packages            - type a space-separated list of packages to install
Dependency type     - pick one of normal, development, peer
```

Confirming will install the new packages.

### Uninstall

Uninstall one or more packages from a target repository:

```
Workspace           - pick the target workspace to uninstall from
Packages            - pick one or more packages to uninstall
```

Confirming will remove the selected packages.

### Update

Update one or more packages in a target repository:

```
Workspace           - pick the target workspace to update
Packages            - type a space-separated list of packages to install
```

Confirming will update the selected packages.

### Reset

Remove all Node modules-related files in all repos, and reinstall:

```
Confirm reset?      - confirm to reset repo and workspaces
```

Confirming will:

- remove all `lock` files
- remove all `node_modules` folders
- re-run `npm|pnpm|yarn install`

Running `reset` can get you out of tricky situations where workspace installs [fail](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/3847) or your IDE reports that seemingly-installed workspaces aren't. 

## Workspaces

### Share

Make a workspace available for use within another workspace:

```
Source workspace    - pick the source workspace to share
Target workspace(s)  - pick the target workspace(s) to update
```

Confirming will:

- set the source workspace as a dependency of the target workspace
- run `npm|pnpm|yarn install`

### Group

Add a new workspace group:

```
Group name          - type a name for the new group
```

Confirming will:

- create a new top-level folder
- add it to the list of workspaces in `package.json`
- ask if the user wants to [add](#add) a new workspace

### Add

Add a new workspace:

```
Workspace group     - pick the target workspace group
Workspace info
 - Workspace        - add name, optional description and `main` file
 - Dependencies     - add optional dependencies
 - Scripts          - add optional scripts
```

Confirming will:

- create a new workspace folder
- create a private package file
- create a stub `"main": "index.ts/js"` file with named export
- optionally install dependencies

### Remove

Remove an existing workspace:

```
Workspace           - pick the target workspace
Type to confirm     - type the name of the workspace to confirm deletion
```

Confirming will:

- remove the dependency from other workspaces
- uninstall workspace dependencies 
- remove the workspace folder
- optionally update the repository's `workspaces` list
