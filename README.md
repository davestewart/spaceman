# üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Spaceman

> Easily manage monorepo / workspace tasks via a prompt-based CLI

## Abstract

Workspaces ‚Äì which are supported by [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces), [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) ‚Äì provide a streamlined workflow to manage multiple packages within a single repository, but require a certain amount of knowledge, configuration and terminal-fu for everyday tasks.


## Overview

Spaceman makes running workspace tasks easier by wrapping them in a question-based format:

</p>

Confirming prompts will update config, run commands, create, update and delete folders or files as needed ‚Äì even stubbing out new workspaces with initial content to let you quickly get up-to-speed with your monorepo setup üöÄ

## Setup

Install the library via NPM:

```bash
npm i @davestewart/spaceman --save-dev
```

## Usage

Run the library by typing its name:

```bash
spaceman
```

You should immediately see set of navigable tasks:

```
? üöÄ Task ‚Ä¶ 
  Packages
  ‚ùØ install
    uninstall
    update
    reset
  Workspaces
    share
    group
    add
    remove
```

Choose a task to run it and view further options:

```
‚úî üöÄ Task ¬∑ install
? Workspace ‚Ä¶ 
  apps
  ‚ùØ docs
    web
  packages
    eslint-config-custom
    tsconfig
    ui
```

The choices should be self-explanatory, but check the documentation below for more detail.

## Packages

### Install

Install one or more packages to a target repository:

```
Workspace           - pick the target workspace to install to
Packages            - type a space-separated list of packages to install
Dependency type     - pick one of normal, development, peer
```

Confirming will install the new packages.

### Uninstall

Uninstall one or more packages from a target repository:

```
Workspace           - pick the target workspace to uninstall from
Packages            - pick one or more packages to uninstall
```

Confirming will remove the selected packages.

### Update

Update one or more packages in a target repository:

```
Workspace           - pick the target workspace to update
Packages            - type a space-separated list of packages to install
```

Confirming will update the selected packages.

### Reset

Remove all Node modules-related files in all repos, and reinstall:

```
Confirm reset?      - confirm to reset repo and workspaces
```

Confirming will:

- remove all `lock` files
- remove all `node_modules` folders
- re-run `npm|pnpm|yarn install`

Running `reset` can get you out of tricky situations where workspace installs [fail](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/3847) or your IDE reports that seemingly-installed workspaces aren't. 

## Workspaces

### Share

Make a workspace available for use within another workspace:

```
Source workspace    - pick the source workspace to share
Target workspace(s)  - pick the target workspace(s) to update
```

Confirming will:

- set the source workspace as a dependency of the target workspace
- run `npm|pnpm|yarn install`

### Group

Add a new workspace group:

```
Group name          - type a name for the new group
```

Confirming will:

- create a new top-level folder
- add it to the list of workspaces in `package.json`
- ask if the user wants to [add](#add) a new workspace

### Add

Add a new workspace:

```
Workspace group     - pick the target workspace group
Workspace info
 - Workspace        - add name, optional description and `main` file
 - Dependencies     - add optional dependencies
 - Scripts          - add optional scripts
```

Confirming will:

- create a new workspace folder
- create a private package file
- create a stub `"main": "index.ts/js"` file with named export
- optionally install dependencies

### Remove

Remove an existing workspace:

```
Workspace           - pick the target workspace
Type to confirm     - type the name of the workspace to confirm deletion
```

Confirming will:

- uninstall workspace dependencies 
- remove the workspace folder
- optionally update the repository's `workspaces` list
